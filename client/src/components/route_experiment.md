profile information 

Goal is to display the loggen in users information from the db (table = users) into the profile page. 
axios?
function?
axios.get from db?


first step is checking to see who is logged into the site. 
JWT token? 
    Need to set a token on log in then 
    
second step is pulling all that users information from the db. 
third step is to decompose the object into seperate strings by colum name. 
fourth step is to insert each string into its spop within the profile page.
