        <p><b>Study buddy</b> is a community where you can find mates to study together.</p> 
        <p>In the <b><i>Study Buddy</i></b> community, we believe that anyone can teach about something.</p>
        <p>Do you have any skills you are really good at? Are you proud of your knowledge about a subject? Have you struggled in the past about something that now you are really confident at? You can be a mentor!</p>
        <p>In our community, we are always happy to see new <b><i>Buddies</i></b> discovering themselves as good teachers, mostly because they can teach as they learned and practiced in real life.</p>
        <p>Find a mentor is as easy as it is to find another student.</p>
