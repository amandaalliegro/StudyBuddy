    <p>Study buddy is a community where you can find mates to study together. You and your buddies will be able to find each other by doing a search using names or your interests in common. You can start a conversation and decide to go forward with the study and even add other people on the chat and have a group.
Set yourself as a student, mentor, or even silent student and enjoy our community by making your contributions on the chats!
Be a buddy, help us to build well-structured knowledge!</p>
